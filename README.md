| **Project Name  ** | **Shopping Web Application** |

###***Description:***

This web application fetch product data from api using ajax. When application runs, it asks user to select product category from a given `dropdown` which type of product data you want to fetch and also user can search `product by name`. By clicking on dropdown button there are no of category are shown e.g smartphone, laptop etc . Select category according to requirement data from API will appear on webpage in tabular form.

Basic goal of app is to implement `AJAX`(asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is to update web page, without reloading the whole page.

#### How to run project :

1. **Clone Project Repository : **

   Clone a project repository from GITHUB to your local . Place the `index.html`file and `script.js` file in this directory.

2. **Start a Local Server : **

   open root folder of web app in vs code and press `f5`or `f10` to run project locally. 

   ####Summary on findings :

   using `AJAX`  I fetch data multiple time with out reloading page. I fount AJAX more fast then traditional approach. AJAX has more syntax then simple `fetch ` method available in `JavaScript` for making http request.

   #### Challenges faced:

   As i am using `AJAX` first time i face different syntax error in `XMLHttpsRequest`  but after using different resources and watching YouTube tutorial i resolved my errors and complete my project.
